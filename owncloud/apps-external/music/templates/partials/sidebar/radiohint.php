		<h2 translate>Setting up radio stations</h2>

		<p translate>You may add radio stations either by manually entering the stream URL or by importing a playlist file containing one or more stream URLs.</p>

		<p translate>If you know the stream URL to add, then press the … symbol next to the navigation item "Internet radio", and select "Add manually".</p>

		<p translate>If you have a PLS or M3U file containing the stream URL, then first upload the file to your cloud using the Files app, press the … symbol next to the navigation item "Internet radio", and select "Import from file". Find the previously uploaded playlist file and press "Choose".</p>

		<p translate translate-params-url="'https://www.radio-browser.info/'">To find radio streams, you may use the <a href="{{url}}" target="_blank">Community Radio Browser</a>. There, you can find channels e.g. by name, language, or style. You may save the results as PLS and follow the instructions above to import them to the Music app.</p>

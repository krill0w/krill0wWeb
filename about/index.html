                <p>This is going to be something soon, or at least that is my hope! I've always tried to commit to making my own site however until fairly recently I've kept ping-ponging between ideas until this one.</p>
                <p>Chances are I'll still end up changing this one, or making a _lot_ of pages with wildly differing designs!</p>
                <p>My biggest motivations for this are the fact that I really want my own place to have a blog or keep all my links, but also to act as refuge from the current state of the internet and the focus on social media.</p>
                <p>I'm hoping to join various webrings and reach out to people in a bid to connect more and maintain my <a href="https://wftg.substack.com/p/2026-ins-and-outs" target="_blank">'ins'</a> for this year.</p>

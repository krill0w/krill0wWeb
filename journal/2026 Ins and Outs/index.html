                <p>I’m starting off 2026 by claiming this little corner of the internet as my own, and essentially starting as I mean to go one: a cup of tea in hand, a good record on and having a good old think.</p>
                <p>Do note that I am yet to decide the tone of this <i>publication</i> (sounds too fancy to be the right word) so expect a lot of fluctuation in that department.</p>
                <h1>Ins</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reading 25+ books and challenging myself with what I'm reading</li>
                    <li>Travelling to go on hikes</li>
                    <li>Putting in effort to make new friends</li>
                    <li>Continuing my obsession with board and card games</li>
                    <li>Getting my thoughts down to paper rather than keeping them for myself</li>
                    <li>Being more mindful of my actions and being more intentional in all I do</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Outs</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>AI usage - not for me but in encouraging other people to think more before they turn to it</li>
                    <li>Not attending work events</li>
                    <li>Staying up until gone 12</li>
                    <li>Procrastinating my hobbies</li>
                    <li>Having a messy room</li>
                    <li>Being a little bit embarrassed of who I inherently am</li>
                </ul>
